```

### Two-Factor Authentication
```http
POST /api/user/2fa/setup                   # Setup 2FA (get QR code)
POST /api/user/2fa/enable                  # Enable 2FA with verification
POST /api/user/2fa/disable                 # Disable 2FA
POST /api/user/2fa/generate-backup-codes   # Generate backup codes
```

### Usage Statistics
```http
GET /api/user/usage                   # Get usage statistics
```

### Admin Operations
```http
GET  /api/user/all                    # Search users (admin only)
POST /api/user/{id}/lock              # Lock user account (admin only)
POST /api/user/{id}/unlock            # Unlock user account (admin only)
POST /api/user/{id}/activate          # Activate user (admin only)
POST /api/user/{id}/deactivate        # Deactivate user (admin only)
GET  /api/user/analytics              # User analytics (admin only)
```

## Usage Examples

### Profile Update
```json
PUT /api/user/profile
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "timeZone": "America/New_York",
  "profilePictureUrl": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg"
}
```

### Password Change
```json
POST /api/user/change-password
{
  "currentPassword": "oldPassword123!",
  "newPassword": "newPassword456@",
  "confirmPassword": "newPassword456@"
}
```

### Two-Factor Authentication Setup
```json
POST /api/user/2fa/setup
Response:
{
  "qrCodeUri": "otpauth://totp/Shortly:user@example.com?secret=...&issuer=Shortly",
  "manualEntryKey": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP",
  "backupCodes": ["123456", "789012", ...]
}
```

### User Search (Admin)
```http
GET /api/user/all?searchTerm=john&role=StandardUser&isActive=true&page=1&pageSize=10
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using BCrypt
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
- Support for password history (TODO: implement in future)

### Account Protection
- Automatic lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- 30-minute lockout duration (configurable)
- Admin can manually lock/unlock accounts

### Two-Factor Authentication
- TOTP-based (Time-based One-Time Password)
- Secure secret generation
- Backup codes for account recovery
- QR code generation for easy setup

### Token Security
- Secure token generation for password reset
- Email verification tokens
- Token expiration and validation

## Subscription Limits

| Plan         | Monthly Links | Features                    |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Free         | 10            | Basic features              |
| Starter      | 100           | Enhanced features           |
| Professional | 1,000         | Advanced features           |
| Enterprise   | Unlimited     | Full feature set            |

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- Validation errors with detailed messages
- Security-aware error responses (don't leak sensitive info)
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Structured error responses

## Testing

## Dependencies

- **BCrypt.Net**: Password hashing
- **FluentValidation**: Input validation
- **AutoMapper**: Object mapping
- **Entity Framework Core**: Data access
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer**: JWT authentication

## Configuration

```json
{
  "App": {
    "Name": "Shortly"
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "AccessTokenExpirationMinutes": 15,
    "RefreshTokenExpirationDays": 7
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Register Dependencies**: Services are automatically registered via `AddCore()` and `AddInfrastructure()`
2. **Run Migrations**: Update database with new User entity structure
3. **Configure Authentication**: Ensure JWT authentication is properly configured
4. **Test Endpoints**: Use the provided API endpoints for user management
